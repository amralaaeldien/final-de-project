https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/halaturkialotaibi/coffee-bean-sales-dataset/data

This is a dataset about coffee bean sales in saudia arabia.
I have created a pipeline to download the data files, load it to GCS, and then loading the data to BigQuery using dlt, then manipulating the data to have an approperiate schema using dbt.

To start using and applying the project then run the Untitled.ipynb file in this directory using Jupyter.
Also install the requirements.txt in this directory.
